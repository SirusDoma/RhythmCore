# RhythmCore

An opinionated micro-framework to bootstrap or prototype your next rhythm game in Unity.  

This Unity package offers an agnostic core implementation for a rhythm game with no dependencies, allowing you to develop a diverse range of 2D / 3D rhythm games with any sound engine, input system, serialization library, or any modules of your choice.  

Be it your classical VSRG (Vertical Scroll-based Rhythm Game) or venturing into a Non-Standard Rhythm Game, you can always start with Rhythm Core!
